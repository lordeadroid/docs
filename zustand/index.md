# [zustand](../index.md)

[Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) is a small, fast, and scalable bearbones state management solution. Zustand has a comfy API based on hooks.

It is made to prevent common pitfalls, like the dreaded [zombie child problem](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#stale-props-and-zombie-children), [React concurrency](https://github.com/bvaughn/rfcs/blob/useMutableSource/text/0000-use-mutable-source.md), and [context loss](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13332) between mixed renderers. It may be the one state manager in the React space that gets all of these right.
